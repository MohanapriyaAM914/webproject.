# 💖 Charity Donation Web Application

This is a simple and responsive charity donation web application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The goal of the project is to provide a platform for users to donate to various ashrams and support people in need.

## 🌟 Features
- ✅ Clean and user-friendly UI
- ✅ Donation form with validation
- ✅ Dynamic ashram selection using URL query parameter
- ✅ Success message after donation
- ✅ Responsive design for all screen sizes
- ✅ Built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
  
 ##📁 Pages
- **Home Page** – Intro and navigation
- **Ashram Page** – List of available ashrams
- **Donate Page** – Form to donate to selected ashram
- **About Page** – Information about the cause and team
- **Contact Page** – Simple contact form

## 🚀 How It Works
1. User selects an ashram from the list (e.g., `aashramam.html`)
2. User is redirected to the donate page with query like:  
   `donate.html?ashram=Sri%20Ram%20Ashram`
3. The donate page dynamically shows the ashram name.
4. User fills out the donation form and submits.
5. A thank you message appears with the donor’s name and amount.
